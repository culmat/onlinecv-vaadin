Vaadin UI for the online CV

The Online CV database is provided with rest services.
The special thing about this UI is that:

* The UI calls the Online CV rest webservice to show and edit the online CVs.
* The object model is generated from a schema file that is provided by the Online CV rest service.
* The UI uses a framework for generating dynamic UIs from POJOs. 
	* This UI layout can easily customized
